					<h1>About me</h1>
					<Message>
						<span>Ever since the age of around 15, I have been a keen software developer, enjoying the experience and challenges in which it provides. I first learnt about programming making games on a platform called scratch (for a school project), I loved it so much I continued to pursue software development subjects at school. My first real programming language was python, which I have used as the stepping stone for all the knowledge I have today (even some slightly different areas such as web development and artificial intelligence).</span>
					</Message>
					<Message>
						<span>Using my knowledge, I have made many projects, some of which are used by thousands of people that I still love to now contribute to in my spare time. I have always been keen to help and teach others as well which is probably why I started my first casual/part-time job at Junior engineers.</span>
					</Message>
					<Message>
						<span>Outside of work, education and programming I love to mountain bike or travel when I get the chance. I also like helping out at my church. On hot summer days (such as now) it is often nice to play games or relax in front of the television for a day watching Sci-fi shows or playing stratgic games (I love to challenge myself!). You can read more about my hobbies in the hobbies section.</span>

						<span>While I have always loved development, I have a few other interests you can read about here to learn more about me!</span>

						<span>One thing I love to do when it is not too hot is to get out mountain biking. Near where I live there are some fantastic bike riding tracks such as Hornsby mountain bike trail and Westleigh mountain bike track. </span>

						<span>I am also a big fan of travelling including canyoning. Just earlier this year I went to Empress falls (in the blue mountains) which included swimming and abseiling on a half-day long walk. I have visited Japan which was a personal highlight of mine, experiencing another culture and bringing home many stories.</span>

						<span>I love gaming and watching movies as well in my spare time. I am not a very serious gamer but prefer more casual and stratgic games. This means I enjoy games like Runescape, World of Tanks, chess and many others. I like learning and thinking about science on the side so sci-fi movies are a great way to pass time. Right now i'm into Stargate and 24.</span>

						<span>Finally, I enjoy helping at my church. This includes assistance during Youth group sessions, managing technical equipment during services and volunteering to serve Jesus where I can.</span>
