					<p>This is the company I have been working at since February 2018. Here I mostly do content development for their online website called <a href="https://codeflix.com.au/">codeflix</a>. I also teach on at least a weekly basis, more in the holidays where I demonstrate some of my leadership skills.</p>
					<p>Most content development I have done with Junior engineers involves javascript and the python programming language. I have taught many languages to kids including Microbits, scratch, small basic, and many many more! üòä</p>

					<p>During my third year industry project, I worked for Macquarie bank to help them speed up their analysis of Alteryx workflows. I worked within a group of 5 where we communicated together to develop a web application called Alteryx smart analyser. It would read the XML of an Alteryx file and neatly display a summary of their contents for the user to see.</p>
					<p>The project invovled constructing a topologically sorted graph which I challenged myself to make without any libraries for maximum control. The final result came out really nicely as shown below.</p>
